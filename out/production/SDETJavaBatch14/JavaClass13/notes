	String is the most widely used class in java. It helps us store and
	manipulate Text based data.
Why we should learn about String class and its methods:
	String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data.
	That why we don't need to write any logic we can simple create the object of the String
	class and can use the method from that class.
Syntax:
	String str=new String("I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls");
	String str2="I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls";
	str2.length();
