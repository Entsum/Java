package JavaClass16;Types of variables in java with respect to their scope:
    There are three types of variables in java with respect to their
    scope. Local instance and static.
Local variables:
    If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop,
    if-condition they are called local variables.
Up-Side of a local variable:
    The upside is they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
    which means other programs on our computer can use that memory.
Down-Side of local variables:
    Their scope is very limited. only inside that block in which they are created.
    we can't access them outside that block.
When to use:
    We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it
    is possible.
Instance variables:
    The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are called
    instance variables.
Up-side:
    We can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class.

DownSide:
    They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.
When we should use instance variables:
    1) When we need to share a value between two or more methods then we should go with the instance variable.
    2) When we are planing to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects can have
    a different value for that variable.
static variable:
    An instance variable with static keyword is called a static variable.
Up-side:
    We can share data across the objects with the help of static variable.
Down-side:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period.
When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.
==================================================================
Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    There are four access levels and three access modifier keywords. These are only applicable to
    instance or static variable not to local variables.
private:
    Private is the most restricted one. if we use private keyword with any variable or method.
    we can only access it within the same class.
When we should use private access modifier.
    We should always try to create variables as private.
    The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.
default access modifier:
    Default is not a keyword. whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or
    public Java assigns default access level to those variables or methods.
    The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed wihin the same class or in any other
    class that is present inside the same package.
Public access modifier:
    Public access most unrestricted access modifier. Once used with an variable or method we can access that variable
    or method anywhere in our project.
Note:

We can have only one public class in a file and the name of that class should match
the name of the file.
