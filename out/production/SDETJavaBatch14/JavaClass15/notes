package JavaClass15;Why we should exclude packages and class from compiling:
    In intellij if we have a syntax error in any of the file in a project we can't run
    another file unless and until we fix that error. some time we want to execute
    code in some files without fixing those issue this is where we should exc
How to Exclude packages:
    Double-click the shift button twice quickly and type excludes and hit enter
    from the pop-up window click on the plus button and select the packages that you
    want to exclude.
How Java code is compiled/executed on a computer:
    We write the code in files with extension .java
    once we hit the run button a software program called compiler checks this code for errors
    and convert it to byte code. usually stored in a folder called bin/out.
    JVM another software further converts this code to binary code and this binary code
    is what is excluded on your computers.
Methods in Java:
    Method is a block of code. or some java statements grouped together.
Why we should learn about the methods:
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. For example if a piece of code
    is being repeated. We can create a method for it and simple call that method
    whenever we need that logic again.
Syntax of creating a method:
    we can create methods only inside a class.
    [datatype] [method name] [(datatype variableName)][method body]
    [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
    [method name] They are like variable names.
    [(datatype variableName)] used to pass data while callinga  method.
How do we decide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword1:
    If we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code which
    require some data from your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void
    type

    String str="hello";
    	int length=str.length();
    	if(!str.isEmpty()&&length%2!=0&&length>=3) {

    		int middleIndex=length/2;
    		System.out.println(str.charAt(middleIndex));
    	}

Types of variables with respect to their scope:
            There are three types of variables w.r.t their scope.
            1) local variables.
            2) instance variables.
            3) static variables.
 Local variables:
            A variables that is created inside a method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable.
 When we should use local variables:
            Local variables occupy the computers memory for the shortest amount of time. We should always go with
            local variables if it is possible, but they are limited in scope we can't use local variables outside the
            block in which they are declared.
            for(int i=0; i<5;i++){
            System.out.println(i);
            }

 Instance variables:
            Which are declared outside a block of code but inside a class are called instance variables.
 static variables:
            if an instance variable has a keyword static is called a static variable.
